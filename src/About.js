        <p>TRIPLESIX or 666 is Technically known as the symbol of evil refering to SATAN also known as devil.</p>
        <p>	
        A devil is the personification of evil as it is conceived in various cultures and religious traditions.
         It is seen as the objectification of a hostile and destructive force.<br></br>
         <br></br>
        It is difficult to specify a particular definition of any complexity that will cover all of the traditions,
         beyond that it is a manifestation of evil. It is meaningful to consider the devil through the lens of each of the cultures
          and religions that have the devil as part of their mythos.</p><br></br>
